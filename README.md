## üìã Project Overview

The Face Attendance Management System is a modern, full-stack application designed to streamline the process of recording attendance through facial recognition. This project leverages a client-centric AI approach, where face detection and embedding generation occur directly in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and fast processing times.

The system provides a complete solution, from administrator-managed student enrollment to a seamless, real-time attendance checking interface. The backend is powered by Supabase, utilizing its powerful combination of a Postgres database with the `pgvector` extension for efficient similarity searches, and serverless Edge Functions for secure, scalable business logic.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Client-Side AI:** Utilizes `face-api.js` to run face detection models directly in the browser, ensuring user images are not transmitted over the network for embedding generation.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** A secure area for administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.
-   **Vector-Based Recognition:** Face embeddings (128-dimension vectors) are stored in Supabase and queried using `pgvector` for highly efficient and accurate similarity searches.
-   **Real-time Attendance:** A simple user interface allows for quick facial captures to mark attendance.
-   **Decoupled Architecture:** A clean separation between the frontend application, server-side actions, and serverless business logic, making the system maintainable and scalable.
